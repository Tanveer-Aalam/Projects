# The "Air-Quality" dataset contains information about air quality measurements in different countries and cities. Each row represents a specific measurement and includes various parameters related to air quality.
### Country: This column represents the name of the country where the air quality measurement was taken.
### City: This column contains the name of the city where the air quality measurement was conducted.
### AQI Value: AQI stands for Air Quality Index, which is a numerical value that represents the overall air quality at a specific location. This column contains an integer value representing the AQI measurement.
### AQI Category: This column provides a categorical description of the air quality based on the AQI value. It represents the overall air quality category, such as "Good," "Moderate," "Unhealthy," etc.
### CO AQI Value: This column represents the Air Quality Index specifically for carbon monoxide (CO) levels. It contains an integer value representing the CO AQI measurement.
### CO AQI Category: Similar to the AQI Category, this column provides a categorical description of the air quality based on the CO AQI value. It represents the air quality category specifically related to carbon monoxide levels.
### Ozone AQI Value: This column represents the Air Quality Index specifically for ozone (O3) levels. It contains an integer value representing the Ozone AQI measurement.
### Ozone AQI Category: This column provides a categorical description of the air quality based on the Ozone AQI value. It represents the air quality category specifically related to ozone levels.
### NO2 AQI Value: This column represents the Air Quality Index specifically for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels. It contains an integer value representing the NO2 AQI measurement.
### NO2 AQI Category: Similar to the previous categories, this column provides a categorical description of the air quality based on the NO2 AQI value. It represents the air quality category specifically related to nitrogen dioxide levels.
### PM2.5 AQI Value: This column represents the Air Quality Index specifically for particulate matter (PM2.5) levels. It contains an integer value representing the PM2.5 AQI measurement.
### PM2.5 AQI Category: This column provides a categorical description of the air quality based on the PM2.5 AQI value. It represents the air quality category specifically related to particulate matter levels.
