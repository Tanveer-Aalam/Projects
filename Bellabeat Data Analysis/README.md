This case study is a Capstone project from the Coursera course - "Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate". The case study is about a company called 'Bellabeat' high-tech company which manufactures health-focused smart products. The co-founder of the company has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. 

This case study particularly focuses on women health and the data is collected from 'Kaggle' through a data source called "Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data". The data source contains 18 CSV files and contains the data related to minute-level output for physical activities, heart-rate and sleep monitoring. The data has been made public and thirty users of the Fitbit app has given their consent to share the data. 

The solution to this case study is to analyse the data using the six phases as per the course - Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share, Act.

The tools used for this project are: Microsoft Excel, R programming language, Jupyter Notebook
