This project involves analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns at Dannyâ€™s Diner to provide insights into customer spending, visit frequency, and favorite menu items. The analysis uses SQL to answer key business questions, helping Danny decide on expanding his loyalty program.

Three main datasets were used:

Sales: Capturing all customer purchases.

Menu: Detailing the menu items and their prices.

Members: Recording when customers joined the loyalty program.

The goal of this project is to help Danny understand his customers better and deliver a more personalized experience, as well as to create basic datasets that his team can use without needing SQL.
